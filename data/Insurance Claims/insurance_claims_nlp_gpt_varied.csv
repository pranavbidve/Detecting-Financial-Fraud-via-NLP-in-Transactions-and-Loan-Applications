The stolen vehicle was her 2015 Ford Escape, parked at 2577 Washington Drive at 9 AM. Despite the minor damage incurred during the theft, fortunately, there were no bodily injuries reported. Sadly, with no witnesses around and the police not contacted immediately, no report was available to aid the investigation.

With 276 months as a loyal customer and an impeccable policy coverage of 100/300, the insured swiftly contacted the authorities after the collision. Fortunately, there were no bodily injuries reported among the passengers of all vehicles involved. Additionally, no witnesses were present at the scene to provide additional context.

Despite the property damage to the insured's vehicle and others, the total claim amount of $65,780 was meticulously broken down into specific categories: $5,980 for injury claim, $11,960 for property claim, and $47,840 for vehicle claim. This detailed breakdown demonstrates the thorough assessment conducted to ensure fair compensation for all parties affected.

Moving forward with precision and care, all necessary information regarding policy deductibles, annual premiums, umbrella limits, as well as capital gains and losses were scrupulously examined to provide a comprehensive overview of the insured's situation.
